The model I've used for my entire thesis is the SMEFTatNLO model that includes
It contains one custom parameter card called restrict_cpG.dat, which is caled in the JO 100014-i/q
for the generation of the cpG operator. It is needed to perform the reweighting.
This restrict_cpG.dat set all the EFT operators to 0 except cpG that is set to 1.

For the rest of the content of the model, one can either move the whole SMEFTatNLO directory into a model directory
or download it via the link: http://feynrules.irmp.ucl.ac.be/wiki/SMEFTatNLO#no1 .
