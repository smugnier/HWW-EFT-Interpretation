This file will explain how to run a sample generation, using a MadGraph job option in the Athena framework

First of all, you need to create a folder where you are going to run your generation.
In this folder, you need to create another folder that HAS to be named with the DSID of the process you want to generate
In this DSID-named folder, you are going to put the MadGraph job option. And then you can run your bash scripts containing the
running parameters (cf. submission-scripts folder in the repo)
e.g.

I want to generate the process with a DSID=10000X, then the folder will look like that:
run-10000X
    10000X
        MadGraph-JO.py
        run.sh
