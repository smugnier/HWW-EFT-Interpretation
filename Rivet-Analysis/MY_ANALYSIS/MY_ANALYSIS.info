Description:

In this analysis, the different observables computed are pT_ll, M_T, m_WW, m_ll, V_x, DEta_ll, DPhi_ll, DR_ll.
It was made with a C++ code which is in the same folder.
If you create your own analysis, you must put everything in the same file and be consistent with the name you choose.
I've kept the name MY_ANALYSIS in all of the file to avoid any troubles with the Rivet code.
For the observables pT_ll, M_T, m_WW, m_ll, V_x I have used 40 bins,
for the others (DEta_ll, DPhi_ll, DR_ll), 20 bins have been used.
It is possible to build your own Rivet analysis by following this tutorial:
